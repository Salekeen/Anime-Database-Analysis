# TO-DO

## Preprocessing
- make the data inline with the format with FM:
  - user: one-hot encoded:
  - items(animes) one hot encoded
  - item normalized
  - other features

Better frame this as Regression task as xlearn only support Binary classification.Also, as I am going to use rating(1-10) for recommendation; it will suffice.
